            <p>In the spirit of ladies first, we'll start with Venus. She is about 4 years old. We first met at an event SPCA had at my job, where you could play with all the 
            dogs and adopt one if it was the right fit. Many people wanted Venus, but she I was lucky enough to get her. I surprised my wife with her, so it 
            could have gone either very good or very bad. Thankfully, my wife fell in love with Venus right away. They quickly became best friends!

            <p style="margin-top: 1%">Most of the time you can find Venus chilling in her bed. If she's not eating or looking for some love, she's probably sleeping. Best way to live if you ask me :)</p>

            <p>As for Ziggy, he's fairly new to the family. My wife and I adopted him from the Pinellas Humane Society in March 2020. He's about 2 years old and has all the energy in 
            the world. However, he will gladly stay in on the bed or couch to chill and watch tv. He's pretty much down for anything. Him and Venus have already become best friends.
            They love to play around and wrestle. Though Venus definitely has a size advantage, Ziggy can hold his own for a little guy.

            <p style="margin-top: 1%">He's honestly the sweetest dog. As long as you feed him, pet him, and give him lots of love, he'll be the happiest dog in the world!</p>

            <p>Though they've only known each other a short while, they've quickly become best friends and love hanging out with each other.
            When they're not running around the house, they're usually sleeping waiting for one of us to play with them.
